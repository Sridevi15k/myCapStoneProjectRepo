**Definition of your audience**
  >Usually most of us wouldn't track the warranty that comes with the products we buy. When it is time to replace the product for any defects in materials or workmanship or functioning, we don't remember if we have registered the product or we wouldn't be sure if there is still warranty time left. We need to put in a lot of money to get a new one when we don't register the product. So to solve this problem, I chose **warranty reminder app** for my capstone project. This website is meant for any individual who buy any kind of product that comes with a warranty from a manufacturer/retailer and willing to save money by putting in a little effort by registering the products they buy so they can be notified before the warranty expires and claim the warranty if necessary. That is getting everything we paid for.

**Definition Statement**
>I want to create a web application called Warranty reminder named **warrantyreminder.com** which is based on full stack web development.

**High Level Story**
>Hi! My name is **Sridevi Kalagara**. I have a background in Biochemistry, Customer Service and IT. I started my career as a Biochemistry instructor, then in IT and the recent one was in customer service. Due to some constraints regarding work authorization, I didn't get a chance to explore my interest for developing a code. My passion has been in analytical and critical problem solving which led me to learn coding concepts. Later I realized I need a mentor so I can go in the right direction to pursue the career of my interest. In this process I came across Savvy Coders over jobs.mo.gov website. The very same day I contacted them, they gave me a chance to attend the preview night and I am so happy that this program is for me.

>I am a person who would like to be well-planned and organized when it comes to any work I take up. For this reason I chose warranty reminder app named **warrantyreminder.com** for my capstone project, which is based on a full stack web development. This website is meant for any individual who buy any kind of product that comes with a warranty and willing to save money by putting in a little effort by registering the products they buy so they can be notified before the warranty expires. My project is a  full stack web development program based on Single Page Application and uses JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS 3, Node.JS/Express.JS, Git/GitHub, Heroku, Netlify, PostgreSQL. The website I am going to design is user friendly, simple and affordable compared to the similar websites I have researched.<br>
